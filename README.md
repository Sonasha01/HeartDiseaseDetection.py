# HeartDiseaseDetection.py
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.
The dataset used is the well-known Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The dataset contains 14 features including age,sex ,chest pain type (4 values) ,resting blood pressure,serum cholestoral in mg/dl,fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl ,resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2
), maximum heart rate achieved,exercise induced angina , oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest , the slope of the peak exercise ST segment , number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect.
The feature of this project is to detect that a person is having a heart disease or not.
